/******************************************************************************
  Displays two grey scale images. On the left is an image that has come from an
  image processing pipeline, just after colour thresholding. On the right is
  the result of applying an edge detection convolution operator to the left
  image. This program performs that convolution.
   
  Things to note:
    - A single unsigned char stores a pixel intensity value. 0 is black, 256 is
      white.
    - The colour mode used is GL_LUMINANCE. This uses a single number to
      represent a pixel's intensity. In this case we want 256 shades of grey,
      which is best stored in eight bits, so GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE is specified as
      the pixel data type.
    
  To compile adapt the code below wo match your filenames:
  mpicc -o MPI-img MPI-img.c -lm -lglut -lGL

  To run:
  mpirun -n 5 ./MPI-img
